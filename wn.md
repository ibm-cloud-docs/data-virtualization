A brief description of the change, fix, release details. If you include the latest feature updates, link to your blog post or post on the blog [announcements page](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements).

The IBM Data Virtualization closed beta is now live.

This offering provides the ability to query data across many systems without having to copy and replicate data. This helps to reduce costs and performance delays associated with duplicated data. Data Virtualization can also simplify your analytics with up to date and accurate data since youâ€™re querying the latest data at its source.

In late June, we will provide this capability as a managed service on IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service. Stay tuned for more details.
