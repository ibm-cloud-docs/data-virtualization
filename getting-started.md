# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.dv_short}}
{: #getting-started}

Use IBM® {{site.data.keyword.dv_short}} to break data silos across hybrid data sources and build a Data Fabric for easy Data Management. You can use {{site.data.keyword.dv_short}} just as you would any data source, but without the time and expense of hardware setup or software installation and maintenance.
{: shortdesc}

For information about using Data Virtualzation with Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, see [documentation](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/dvaas/dvaas-overview.html).

1. After creating the {{site.data.keyword.dv_short}} service on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you must create IAM service credentials by clicking the **Service credentials** tab on your service page and selecting **New credential**. Technically, you can log in to the web console without credentials, but you need the service credentials to use many of the {{site.data.keyword.dv_short}} tools. 
2. To retrieve your **service credentials**, select the Service credentials tab from your service page and expand the credentials that you want to view.
