# Identity and access management (IAM) on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #iam}

Identity and access management (IAM) enables you to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources consistently across the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform. For example, with only a single login to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} with your IBMid, you have access to any of your service consoles and their applications without having to log in to each of them separately.

IAM is enabled for all {{site.data.keyword.dv_short}} plans. For more information, see [Connecting and authenticating to the Watson Query service](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/dvaas/auth-usercred-dv.html){: external}.
