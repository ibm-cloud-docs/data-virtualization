# Understanding high availability and disaster recovery for Data Virtualization
{: #dr}

_The short description should be a single, concise paragraph that contains one or two sentences and no more than 50 words. Summarize your offering's strategy for DR._ 
{: shortdesc}

_Document the list of regions or data centers that your offering is available in. For other details, work with your offering management and development teams to define what DR documentation is required for your offering. At a minimum, use the following sections to document the following details:_

_* The automatic DR capabilities that your offering provides, for example, global load balancing, multi-availability zones, data replication or data mirroring, active-active or active-passive clusters_

_* If applicable, the supported tools that your offering provides to help users create their own DR capabilities_

_* Application deployment considerations_

_Do not include any details that would give malicious persons an advantage to compromising your offering environment._

## Using the standard template
{: #dr-standard}

_If your offering complies with the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} standards of availability, use the standard template that we provide. See the following example._

All {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} general availability (GA) offerings have a Service Level Agreement of 99.99% availability. _your-offering-name_ is a GA service that is offered in _Dallas, Frankfurt, and London_. Each location has three different data centers for redundancy.
